"""Prove the turnstile actually turns.

    python3 tests/fake_device_test.py

A fake Tiiny that behaves like the real one in the way that matters: it accepts one
inference at a time and answers 150004 to anything that overlaps. Then we point real
worker PROCESSES at it, because in-process queuing is the easy half of the problem and
testing only that would prove nothing.

The suite includes a CONTROL that hammers the fake device without a turnstile. If the
control does not collide, the test is not measuring anything and says so.
