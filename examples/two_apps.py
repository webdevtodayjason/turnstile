"""Two applications, one Tiiny, no collisions.

    python3 examples/two_apps.py            # against your real device
    python3 examples/two_apps.py --fake     # against the test fake, no hardware needed

App A is a ticker: short, frequent summaries, the way a dashboard behaves.
App B is a storyteller: long, occasional generations, the way a narrative app behaves.

They are separate PROCESSES that have never heard of each other. The only thing they
share is a Turnstile pointed at the same device. Run it and watch the interleaving in
the log: nobody waits long, nobody is refused, and the device is never asked to do two
things at once.

Run it once with `--chaos` to see what the same two programs look like without the
turnstile. That is the version people write first.
