"""Turnstile — let two applications share one Tiiny without fighting over it.

    pip install nothing.  Copy this file next to yours.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A Tiiny Pocket performs ONE inference at a time. Issue a second call while another
is in flight and the device answers:

    {"code": 150004, "message": "The operation failed to complete."}

Inside a single program that is easy — queue your own calls. It stops being easy the
moment a second program touches the same device, because your queue and its queue know
nothing about each other. Two well-behaved applications, each perfectly serialised on
its own, will still collide constantly.

We learned this running a 24/7 news board and a bedtime storyteller against one device.
This module is that lesson, extracted and cleaned up so nobody else has to rediscover it.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
* Serialises every device call across PROCESSES, not just threads, using an advisory
  file lock. If a holder crashes, the kernel releases the lock — no stale-lock cleanup,
  no heartbeat, no daemon to run.
* Retries the two failures that mean "busy, try again" — device code 150004 and HTTP
  502/503/504 — with exponential backoff and jitter.
* Optionally tracks the 100-unit model residency budget in a small shared ledger, so an
  application can ask "will my model fit?" before it evicts somebody else's.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It is not a daemon, a scheduler, or a priority system. It is a turnstile: one at a time,
first come first served, nobody gets stuck. That is deliberately the smallest thing that
solves the actual problem.

USAGE
-----
    from turnstile import Turnstile

    t = Turnstile()                       # reads TIINY_HOST / TIINY_KEY

    reply = t.chat("deepreinforce-ai/Ornith-1.0-35B",
                   [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello"}])

    png = t.image("Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo", "a lighthouse at dusk", seed=7)

    with t.hold("rendering a page"):       # several calls, nothing interleaves
        a = t.chat(...)
        b = t.image(...)

Everything blocks until the device is free. That is the point.
